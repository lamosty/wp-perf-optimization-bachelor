\section{Load balancing}

Load balancing is a method of distributing computations across multiple servers, thus optimizing server use, maximizing throughput, minimizing response time and avoiding overload of a single server. Nginx's module called upstream \cite{Nginx:Upstream} is used to define groups of servers that can be referenced in server blocks of different sites. 

\section{Perception of speed}

Apart from optimizing the web server software and hardware efficiency, it is important to design a web application in a way that it will be perceived as fast and responsive by its visitors. One method of doing so is to use asynchronous JavaScript (Ajax) techniques to load additional data from a server after a site has been loaded by a user while providing visual guides of the to-be loaded data on the site.
